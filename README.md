# Multiplayer Egg Clicker Mobile Application
<p align="justify">The Multiplayer Egg Clicker App is a competitive multiplayer mobile game. The basic idea is that there is a match and each match consists of several rounds. In addition, each player has an egg, and each egg has a counter. In each round, if a player clicks (or touches) on their egg faster than the other players, they will be the round winner. A number will be added to their egg counter if someone wins the round. Finally, if a player reaches the number 30 for their egg counter, they will be the match-winner.</p>
